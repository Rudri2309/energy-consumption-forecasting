Energy Consumption Forecasting :
This project focuses on forecasting the average daily energy consumption using SARIMAX models, weather data, and public holidays, visualized through a dynamic Tableau Dashboard.

Project Structure: 
Data Cleaning & Merging — Combined raw energy readings, weather, and holiday data.

Feature Engineering — Added moving averages, month, weekday, lag features.

Modeling — Built a SARIMAX model with (1,1,0)x(0,1,0,7) configuration, achieving a validation RMSE of 0.4951.

Visualization — Created interactive Tableau dashboards comparing historic, weather, and future forecast data.

Dashboard Highlights: 
Historic Energy Consumption Trends

Comparative Analysis (Temperature, Humidity, Energy)

Temperature vs Energy Consumption (with humidity coloring)

Predicted Future Energy Consumption

Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn)

Tableau Public

SARIMAX Time Series Modeling

How to Run: 
Clone the repo:
